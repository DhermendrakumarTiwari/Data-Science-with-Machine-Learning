It takes qualitative values representing different categories, and there is no intrinsic ordering of these categories\n","\n","You can code nominal variables with numbers, but the order is arbitrary and arithmetic operations cannot be performed on the numbers.

The variables in ordinal data are listed in an ordered manner. The ordinal variables are usually numbered, so as to indicate the order of the list. However, the numbers are not mathematically measured or determined but are merely assigned as labels for opinions.\n","\n","In another sense, we could say the difference in the rank of an ordinal variable is not equal.

Including a dummy variable for each is redundant (of male is 0, female is 1, and vice-versa), however doing so will result in the following linear model:\n","\n","\n","\n","y ~ b + {0|1} male + {0|1} female"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tVaLwSRXNAoH"},"source":["#Multicollinearity\n","\n","Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are correlated.
